# **LOG AUTOMATION**

### Overview

Log Automation is a Python-based project designed to validate and process log files for .NET and Java applications. This tool streamlines log validation and helps ensure consistency in your logs.

### Features

- Supports log validation for both .NET and Java applications.

- Easy-to-use Python scripts with customizable configurations.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.8 or later

- Required Python packages (listed in requirements.txt)

### Setup Instructions

- Clone the repository or extract the ZIP file:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Log_Automation-main
```

- Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Verify the setup by running one of the scripts with sample input logs.

### Usage

##### Log Validation for .NET

To validate .NET logs, run the log_validation_for_dot_net.py script:

```bash
python log_validation_for_dot_net.py <path-to-dot-net-log-file>
```

##### Log Validation for Java

To validate Java logs, run the log_validation_for_java.py script:

```bash
python log_validation_for_java.py <path-to-java-log-file>
```

Replace <path-to-dot-net-log-file> and <path-to-java-log-file> with the actual paths to your log files.

### Examples

Example Command for .NET Logs

```bash
python log_validation_for_dot_net.py ./logs/dot_net_example
```

Example Command for Java Logs

```bash
python log_validation_for_java.py ./logs/java_example
```
